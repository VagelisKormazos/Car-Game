# Game-In-C-

The user has to collect points by tapping on a car (graphic) that moves around the screen and changes position (randomly). The game lasts for a certain amount of time, 20 seconds with countdown.
You are invited to extend the game's capabilities by implementing the following additional features:
- Existence of difficulty levels (easy-difficult). These can be done by modifying: the time of the graphic display, the size of the graphic and the size of the screen/form, changing the colours of the form (red-green).
- Recording user data at the start of the game (asking for user name), so that everyone can know their performance (try to put in date/time as well)
- Use of sounds
- Menu options at the top of the form (menustrip)
- Saving user data in a txt file (can be achieved via a richtextBox.
- Optional: Existence of highest score.
